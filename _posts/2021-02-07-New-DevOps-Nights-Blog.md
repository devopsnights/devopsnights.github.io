I have been sharing my knowlegde with the software community since some years ago, but over the past year, due the pandimic situation, and the necessity to stay home and avoid crowds, I decided to use this time share to increased my contributions with the community to occupy myself during this period.

This decision brought some good results, such as the DevOps Nights program within the DevelopersBR community. It is a program that we have invited to present subjects related to DevOps and Cloud.

Another good result was many posts on my personal blog on Medium. I had many views and seeing this result made me very happy to be on the right track.

Last but not least, I was nominated as a Microsoft MVP, which was a recognization from Microsoft due to all my contribution.

Now I decided to create this blog, with the DevOps Nights name, to group all my activities inside this. I´ll keep my previous post on Medium, but all my new posts will be in this blog.
